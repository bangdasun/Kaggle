#### About My Solution (130/7198)

For now I'm still heavily using jupyter notebook and jupyter lab to do the whole job. I'm still on my way to build a solid pipeline for competitions. Therefore here are just code copy and paste from my notebooks. Sorry for the inconvenience, you're very welcome to contact me (email/linkedin/wechat) if you have any questions with my code. 

My final submission is based on blending of several LightGBM/XGBoost/CatBoost, here I just upload code for one main model.

I have my collection of helper function which I will use, it is called `kaggle_learn`, here is the repo [bangda/kaggle_learn](https://github.com/bangdasun/kaggle_learn).

Thanks for reading.
