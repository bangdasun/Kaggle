### Mercari Price Suggestion

#### Competition Introduction

Build regression models to give reference price of product based on product contents (product category, brand name, product description, etc). It's a combination of NLP and tabular data. Also, this is a kernel only competition, which means we are required to submit code in kernel instead of pure predictions.

#### About My Solution

The competition was ended 9 months ago (2018.2.21). This is my first featured competition, where previously I was a Statistics background student and didn't have much programming experience. Therefore I had a hard time during the competition, I had to start from kernels and discussions. Unfortunately, my submitted kernels were fail to give submissions due to a unexpected bug in the code, therefore I ranked at the tail. Now I recover my submissions and they could successfully get the new test predictions which could rank around 80/2384. My two submissions are:

- Blend of FTRL and FM models (based on [wordbatch](https://github.com/anttttti/Wordbatch))
- Ridge models based on last day best kernel

It's a big regret that I missed a medal. But the good thing was I learned a lot (ML / Feature Engineering / Coding) and never stop kaggling since then.

Thanks for reading.
